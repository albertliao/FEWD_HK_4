# But First! 
<aside class="notes">Mart</aside>

## The make-up class!



# Introduction To Programming
<aside class="notes">Mart ~ 10 Min</aside>



<aside class="notes">Mart</aside>
## Program
A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do

---

## Programming

__Programming__ is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

## Becoming A Programmer

It isn't about the programming language. It is about changing how you think.

We have to know how the computer thinks to change how we think.

---

##How Computers ‘Think’

The short answer is that they don’t think.

The slightly longer answer is that while computers don’t think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.

The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.



## Pseudo Code
<aside class="notes">Kit ~ 10 Min</aside>

* A script of a computer program
* It's just like a wireframe of a program



## Pseudo Code

### Example - Wage calculator

Here is the business logic

* Hourly rate
  * $500/hr if work within 4 hours
  * $600/hr if more than 4 hours
  * Bonus $500 if work more than 8 hours



## Pseudo Code
<aside class="notes"></aside>

```
// variable
get working_hours

// calculate
if working_hours <= 4
  wage = working_hours x 500
else if working_hours <= 8
  wage = working_hours x 600
else if working_hours > 8
  wage = working_hours x 600 + 500
```



## Pseudo Code
<aside class="notes"></aside>

### What does this program do?

```
target_temperature = 26
repeat forever,
  current_temperature = get_sensor_reading
  if (target_temperature - 1) > current_temperature,
    turn_on_heater
  if target_temperature <= current_temperature,
    turn_off_heater
```
